## Plot twist: Curiosity didn’t kill the cat.

I recently attended a talk by Steve Harrison, a legend in the creative field, on how to be more creative. More simply, we discussed what makes good advertising and the people behind it. Unsurprisingly, I was curious to know about the people side of the story. 

I left this talk feeling inspired and ready for new challenges, but one of the key takeaways for me was the role of curiosity in advertising and, indeed, life. He talked about the need to appeal to consumers curiosity, and then he went on to talk about how this had also impacted the way he hired - and admired - people. He advocates the idea that you know you have made a good decision in hiring someone when they are curious to know why things happen, how things work and begin by asking questions. Those are the people that make real change. 

The day before I saw Steve Harrison speak, I received my copy of Stay Curious by Clare Hieatt, a co-founder of the DO Lectures. This book talks the reader through the journey of the DO Lectures in its first 10 years. Curiosity plays a key role – no surprises there. Building a world-class event in a cowshed in Wales must take some imagination, curiosity and consideration. The Hieatts have done an incredible job in hand-crafting an experience that changes people and inspires action. One day I hope to attend and be changed too. 

I have always been a curious cat – ask my parents, my teachers and my friends. They’d probably call it annoying. But here I am, having lived and studied abroad, moved to London and travelled Australia on my own. All down to my curious nature. 

Curiosity is part of all of us. Some are more curious than others, but nevertheless it’s part of being human. Curiosity can take you to many different places – from building a world-class event or an award-winning agency. Let your curiosity get the better of you – I dare you.

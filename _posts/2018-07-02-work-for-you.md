## Work for you - how to work from home.

Since finishing university, I have decided to pursue my passion in life. I set up meetings with interesting people, gained different perspectives and tried to pave the path I wanted for myself. Sometimes its left me feeling even more confused and feeling lost with no direction. But that’s ok. I’m learning. 

Over the last few years I have learnt more and more about myself and the way I work. I know I need to be challenged because I enjoy learning. I decided I needed a project, something to focus my energy on. So, I sat myself down and wrote a plan. Anyone out there obsessed with lists, diaries, colour coordination? Yep, me too. 

I decided a few things: launch this site, present my thesis research findings to an audience, read more and explore my employment options. Firstly, I didn’t know how I wanted my website to look, but my favourite colour has always been orange and my auburn hair is something that has always made me stand out from others. So, I figured that was a good place to start. I have also learnt that sometimes it’s not about perfection, it’s about getting it out there into the world. Secondly, I haven’t presented anything in a very long time, so I thought it might be an interesting challenge to throw myself in at the deep end. Lastly, I needed to begin a new learning journey. I knew that in order to pursue the career I wanted, I needed to **[pave my own path](http://catherineritchie.co.uk/2018/06/06/pave-your-own-path.html)**. That means reading, going to events, talking to people and doing all that you can to break out on your own. 

In my endeavour to pave my path, I had to get used to working from home every day. I have learnt that the following few steps have led me to be productive in the comfort of my own home. 

**1.	Give yourself office hours that work for you**
- Consider your daily routine and commitments (Kids? Pets? Family?)
- Think about when might be best to communicate with others (Clients? Colleagues?)



**2.	A change of scenery can go a long way**
- Often a shift in scenery can help free up your mind 
- You never know who’ll you’ll meet out there
- You never know what inspiration might hit you in a different setting



**3.	Pat yourself on the back**
- Recognise your achievements because no one else is going to tell you ‘good job’



**4.	Regular exercise**
- Healthy body, healthy mind – it’s not a lie



Once again, do what works for you, there is no set path. We must do what we can to build a future for ourselves, follow our passions and learn.

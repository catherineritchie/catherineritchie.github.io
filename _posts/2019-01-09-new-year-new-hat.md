## New Year, New Hat

### Bringing all my learnings forward into 2019, I am pleased to make a few - very exciting - announcements!

This week I started work as Marketing Assistant for **[The Do Book Co.](https://thedobook.co/)** When I graduated and was spending time contemplating the value I wanted to bring to the world, I selected my top three companies and I sent them each an email. Miranda, founder of the Do Book Co. responded with great enthusiasm, and a few weeks later we had coffee. Fast forward a couple of months, and here I am. 

The Do Book Co. brings a **[wealth of inspiration](https://www.instagram.com/dobookco/?hl=en)** to anyone who picks up any of the books. Designed to help kickstart a project, or new learning journey, these books give you the tools and the power to DO. Written by a collection of inspiring writers and speakers from all over the world who have spoken at the **[Do Lectures](https://www.thedolectures.com/)**, an annual ideas festival in West Wales. There is great value, experience and wisdom in the voices behind the words. The fact that these beautiful books can bring all of this to anyone who picks one up, is the reason I selected them within the top three.

Not only have I begun a new journey alongside The Do Book Co. from Wednesday to Friday, I have begun my own solo adventure. Entering the world as Catherine Ritchie, Freelance Workplace Culture Consultant and Marketing Whiz, I have some exciting opportunities to work with some incredible people, and help businesses engage and inspire their workforce and teams. 

Using my knowledge, experience, award-winning research findings and enthusiasm, I am determined to help employers engage their workforce, increase productivity and workplace wellbeing. 

If you’d like to get in touch, drop me a line at info@catherineritchie.co.uk. Always happy to chat, learn and listen.

Anyway, I hope you’ve all had a cracking start to the year. I wish you all health and happiness.

## Three key steps in building resilience.

I recently stumbled upon a short video discussing resilience, and I thought ‘this is exactly what I needed to hear’. We need to talk more about the importance of resilience.

At the moment, myself and other recent graduates are paving new and independent paths for ourselves in an endeavour to figure out who we are, what we want to contribute to an organisation and indeed, the world. This post acts as a follow-up to my [**previous post**](http://catherineritchie.co.uk/2018/07/20/try,-try-and-try-again.html) about keeping confident in the face of uncertainty. 

Resilience is often defined as the strength and speed of our response to adversity, or the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties. While there are much more severe and much more traumatic events that take place in the world every day, we as individuals still struggle in the face of our own uncertainties. 

What I have learned through experience and reading is that resilience must be built. We are not born with ‘X’ amount of resilience, but it is something that will grow and develop over time as we encounter the inevitable highs and lows of life. Sometimes our problems can feel all-consuming, but it could be a lot worse. Be thankful for what you do have and celebrate even the smallest of successes. 

It is our attitude and the way we process the events that will help build resilience and aid our ability to overcome even the most difficult of circumstances. In my personal experience, I have overcome setbacks with three simple mantras I know to be true: 


1.	Whatever has set me back has taught me something new 
2.	It is setbacks and failures that make us human and make us who we are 
3.	If we work hard and practice kindness, nobody can ask anymore of you 


My three simple statements have helped me overcome much more than my recent anxieties in the search for my first graduate role, and my first steps into the real world. They have helped me through much more difficult times too. I hope you can practice these simple steps and know that - even in the face of rejections and difficult times - you are enough, and you will get there.

Hello! Welcome to my space on the internet to talk about all things people in the workplace. I am passionate about organisational culture, employee engagement and meaningful work.

Allow me to introduce myself, I am Catherine Ritchie, a red-headed scot determined to make a difference in workplace culture. I recently completed research in the field of internal marketing, organisational culture and entrepreneurial orientation, and found culture to be an extremely powerful component of workplace life. From this, employee engagement and meaningful work was highlighted as core attributes to a healthy and productive organisational culture. I began to question – why isn’t this at the core of business practice? 

I have never been afraid to ask ‘why?’, eager to understand different perspectives and points of view. I have developed this online space to learn more, host conversations, offer food for thought and help us all learn about how we can gain value in our day-to-day working lives.

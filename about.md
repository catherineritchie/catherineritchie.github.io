Hello! Welcome to my space on the internet to talk about all things human. Allow me to introduce myself, I am Catherine Ritchie, an award-winning marketing graduate, marketing whiz and all round thinker, maker and doer. I am on a mission to help others lead fulfilling and meaningful working lives.

I am passionate about people and determined to help people be their best selves every day. This means you'll find me talking about workplace culture, employee engagement, meaningful work and kindness. As a firm believer in equality, you might also find me talking about women in business.

I have developed this online space to learn more, offer food for thought and help us all learn about how we can gain value in our day-to-day. Follow my journey, connect with me and let's have a conversation.
